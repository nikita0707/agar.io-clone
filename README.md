# Agar.io clone

In this project, I tried to replicate the basic mechanics of agar.io in Unity Engine.
Without multiplayer, but with simple AI, that just go to nearest food on the map.

Main part:
- [x] 2D game
- [x] Music
- [x] Main menu
- [x] Choosing player color

Bonus part:
- [x] Enemies with simple AI
- [x] Scoreboard
